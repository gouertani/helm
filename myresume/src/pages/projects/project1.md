Redesign and migration of the TIM-VIP application from a desktop to a web application. Responsible for planning and designing the entire infrastructure architecture of the project.

Utilized Harbor as an image registry and Nexus as a binary artifactory, both deployed on Hetzner Cloud, with proper role and permission configurations to enhance security. Implemented CloudBeaver for cloud-based database access.

Containerized the application, developed with Spring Boot and ReactJS, using PostgreSQL as the database. Set up the CI/CD pipeline on Bitbucket. Provisioned instances on Hetzner using Ansible and Terraform.
